**Explanation:**

Transaction processing involves the execution of discrete tasks or operations initiated by end users interacting with programs running on a mainframe system. These tasks are typically short-lived and require quick responses, often measured in seconds or fractions of a second. A key component of transaction processing is the use of a database system, such as DB2 for z/OS, to store and manage data accessed by these transactions.

**Use Case:**

Consider the following scenario to illustrate transaction processing:

| Scenario           | Process                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | Result                                                                     |

| **ATM Transaction** | - The customer visits an ATM to perform a transaction.<br>- The ATM presents a user-friendly interface offering various functions like withdrawal, balance inquiry, deposit, transfer, or cash advance from a credit card account.<br>- The customer selects the desired function, enters relevant information such as account number and amount, and confirms the transaction. | The transaction is completed within seconds, and the customer receives a receipt confirming the transaction. |

This use case demonstrates how transaction processing facilitates quick and efficient interactions between end users and the mainframe system, leveraging database systems to ensure data integrity and reliability. Whether it's banking, retail, or insurance, transaction processing plays a crucial role in enabling seamless and secure financial transactions and business operations.
